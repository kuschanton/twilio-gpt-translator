# Productisation ideas

- Dial, ask for number and language, dial the number
- Welcome message for the callee (instruction on translator behaviour) 
- Allow for CLI verification to have my number as CLI
- Calling back
  - Then CLI is not needed as it should be a Twilio number
  - Language prompt before forwarding the call
